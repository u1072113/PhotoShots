Introduction

I am a part time photographer and I have decided to create a web application which will make my work easier. Usually after photoshoots I have to pass the photographs to my client.
I have developed a website in Laravel which allow users to register to the application, create albums and add pictures within the albums.

How does it work?

1.	Homepage
The home page of the application allows users to login and create an account but also see statistics of how many albums has been created in the past 30 days.

2.	Registration
User will be able to register with their details such as name, email address, password, a question in order to be answered with the secret answer if the user forgets the password.
3.	Once the user is logged in.
Albums can be created with a title and description.
Photos can be added inside the albums, with a title and description, pictures canâ€™t be larger than 30MB.
Photos and albums have an edit and a delete button, the edit button will edit the title and description.
User can edit his/her profile; updating name, email address, password.

The photo ID is linked to an album then an album is linked to an user, this is how information is being pulled.
